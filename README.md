❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning classification techniques. By analyzing medical and demographic attributes, the model helps in early detection of heart disease, which can support doctors and healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, model training, and performance comparison across multiple machine learning algorithms.

🎯 Objectives
